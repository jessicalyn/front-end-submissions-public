 # Code Quality

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/kimmichurri/FE-Palette-Picker/blob/master/src/containers/Projects/Projects.js)

 * Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
- Lines 90-117: We created a nested map in order to display palettes with their corresponding projects.

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/kimmichurri/FE-Palette-Picker/blob/master/src/containers/Projects/Projects.js)

 * Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
- Projects.js has a lot of functionality in it. We would have wanted to refactor and possibly break some of the functionality into smaller components.

 #### Link to Design Inspiration

 #### Reflection on New Concepts

 * Describe your thoughts on server-side testing  
-It went well, we feel comfortable testing both happy and sad paths on the server-side.

* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI  
- It was a little slow to start, but once we learned how it worked it benefits our project by making sure you only deploy good code. We wish we could have implemented TravisCI on our front-end.

* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
- It wasn't too bad. We've had the experience of creating one Github repo with two repos inside. Having multiple respositories simplified the process and separated our concerns. Now anyone can use our back-end without needing the front-end!
